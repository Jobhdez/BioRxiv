# bioRxiv-web
a Django web app 

# what does it do?
This web app was an exercise to learn how to populate or seed the databse using an external api. In this case I used the BioRxiv api.

I have also, in another exercise, implemented pagination. So, I have an idea of how to implement this.

# Using the web app

After you clone this: `git clone https://github.com/Jobhdez/BioRxiv.git`, and have run `python3 manage.py runserver`, point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/bioarxiv/` and you will see abstracts of research papers with pagination.
