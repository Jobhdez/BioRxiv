# bioRxiv-web
a web app 

# what does it do?
it populates the databse using the BioRxiv api.

After you clone this: `git clone https://github.com/Jobhdez/BioRxiv.git`, and have run `python3 manage.py runserver`, point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/bioarxiv/` and you will see abstracts of research papers. 

*Hopefully* I can add more functionality and deploy it so people in the Bio community can use it.
